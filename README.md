# 📊 Strik3Zone – Models & Metrics Repository

Welcome to the **Strik3Zone Models & Metrics Repo**, the central brain of our sports analytics system. This repository houses the full suite of **custom scoring models**, **ranking logic**, and **metric formulas** used across the Strik3Zone platform.

---

## 📌 Purpose

This repo is focused entirely on the **logic, formulas, and evaluation models** that power our fantasy rankings, scouting reports, reliever scoring, and betting insights.

It is **decoupled from the frontend/backend web application**, which lives in the [WebApp-001 repository](https://github.com/Strik3Zone/WebApp-001/).

## ⚙️ Core Models

| Model           | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `STORM`         | Reliever reliability scoring model (Stat Tracking On Relief Metrics)        |
| `Fantasy$Value` | Converts player performance into auction-style fantasy dollar valuations     |
| `ProspeX`       | Prospect tracking and future impact projection model                         |
| `Team Index`    | Franchise value, fan loyalty, and performance-based team scoring             |
| `BetIQ`         | Advanced betting model tracker using EV, volatility, and trend logic         |

Each model has its own:
- 📐 Formula documentation
- 🐍 Python implementation
- 📊 Weight configuration files
- ✅ Version changelog

Would you like me to:

- Generate the matching folder structure in your local or GitHub repo?
- Create `formula_index.md` with starter entries for STORM, Fantasy$, etc.?
- Add a sample `storm.py` template that imports weights and applies scoring?

Let me know and I’ll scaffold the rest out!
